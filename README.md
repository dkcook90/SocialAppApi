  ## Installation Instructions

  Clone this git repository, open the repo, then run "node (or nodemon) server.js". Once the server is running, you will then need to use a program like Insomnia to test existing and new endpoints, as there is no front end.

  ## Usage Information

  The primary usage is to base a new social media platform off of this structure. Or to use this repo as a test folder for new endpoints on an existing social media platform.
